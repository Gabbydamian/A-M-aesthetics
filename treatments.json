Genetics and lifestyle factors (such as being overweight) are said to play a part in their presence across the skin. CryoPen XP treatment is an advanced version of its previous counterpart (CryoPen), employing pinpoint accuracy that works down to a millimetre. It works by freezing unwanted skin lesions.
